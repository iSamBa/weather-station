# My Weather Station
This is my solution for the Web Bootcamp.
At this stage EJS was not introduced, that is why i return a complete HTML in String format.
## Run the solution
1.  Run ``` npm install ```
2.  Add a .env file in which you specify a variable TOKEN that contains your OpenWeatherMap token
3.  Run ``` npm run start ```
4.  Open your browser at http://localhost:3000
